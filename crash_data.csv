A vehicle behind the AV was traveling approximately the same speed as the May shuttle. The May AV began to slow for an object ahead. Due to weather conditions, the AV misclassified a speed limit sign as a pedestrian, which intersected with the predicted trajectory of the AV. This caused the May AV to apply additional braking to avoid the projected collision with the misclassified object. The following vehicle did not react promptly when the May AV started to slow down, resulting in the following vehicle braking too late to avoid collision and impacting the May AV from behind.  The following vehicle then pulled around the May vehicle and drove away.  Resimulation of this event with an upcoming software version shows that the May AV would not misidentify the non-exist object so would not have decelerated unnecessarily. This improved software is set to be deployed to the full commercial fleet soon. In addition, per May policy, the commercial fleet would not operate in weather conditions like those present in this incident.",

The Aurora vehicle was operating in autonomy at the time. Conditions were clear. As the Aurora vehicle was driving in its lane at 62 mph, a box truck veered into the lane of the Aurora vehicle. The box truck's mirror appeared to make contact with the back of the trailer that the Aurora Driver was pulling. At this time, we are not aware of any injuries, and camera footage appears to show that the box truck continued to drive. From the post-trip inspection, there was not any visible trailer damage. Before the collision, the Aurora Driver was driving straight in its lane and passing the box truck. Shortly thereafter, the box truck began to encroach into the lane of the Aurora Driver. The Aurora Driver detected the box truck's encroachment into the Aurora vehicle's lane and initiated a nudge away from the box truck to provide space. The Aurora Driver detected the collision and made the decision to initiate an incident response, but before it could execute that response, the Vehicle Operator took over control of the system and proceeded in manual. The Aurora vehicle then re-engaged in autonomy approximately two minutes later. 
The Vehicle Operator did not visually observe the collision, assumed the reaction of the Aurora Driver to be a software anomaly, and reported the vehicle nudge through the standard annotation protocol rather than through the incident response protocols. The incident was identified at approximately 1:03 PM CT on February 2, 2024, through a review of Aurora's data logs.",

On February [XXX], 2024 at 2:34 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a bicyclist on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on [XXX] and came to a stop at a 4-way stop sign intersection at [XXX]. When it was the Waymo AVs turn at the intersection, the Waymo AV entered the intersection to proceed straight. At this point, a delivery truck traveling eastbound on [XXX] was already in the middle of the intersection (the delivery truck arrived at its stop sign first and proceeded into the intersection before the Waymo AV). As the Waymo AV passed the rear of the delivery truck, an occluded bicyclist who was traveling behind the delivery truck became visible and was making a sharp left turn onto northbound [XXX], in front of the Waymo AVs path. The cyclist had entered the 4-way stop intersection without stopping or yielding. The Waymo AV detected the bicyclist, applied heavy braking, but was unable to avoid contact with the bicyclist before coming to a full stop. 
At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor body damage, and the bicyclist reported minor injuries and damage to their bicycle. The Waymo AV remained stopped in the intersection for approximately one minute, and after the path was clear, resumed driving for a short period of time. The Waymo AV was then returned to the scene by one of Waymos roadside assistance specialists. The Waymo AV did not require towing and was returned to the depot in manual mode.

At this time, we are not aware of any injuries, and camera footage appears to show that the box truck continued to drive. From the post-trip inspection, there was not any visible trailer damage. 
Before the collision, the Aurora Driver was driving straight in its lane and passing the box truck. Shortly thereafter, the box truck began to encroach into the lane of the Aurora Driver. The Aurora Driver detected the box truck's encroachment into the Aurora vehicle's lane and initiated a nudge away from the box truck to provide space. The Aurora Driver detected the collision and made the decision to initiate an incident response, but before it could execute that response, the Vehicle Operator took over control of the system and proceeded in manual. The Aurora vehicle then re-engaged in autonomy approximately two minutes later. 
The Vehicle Operator did not visually observe the collision, assumed the reaction of the Aurora Driver to be a software anomaly, and reported the vehicle nudge through our standard annotation protocol rather than through our incident response protocols. We identified the incident at approximately 1:03 PM CT on February [XXX], 2024 through a review of our data logs.",

The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on [XXX] and came to a stop at a 4-way stop sign intersection at [XXX]. When it was the Waymo AVs turn at the intersection, the Waymo AV entered the intersection to proceed straight. At this point, a delivery truck traveling eastbound on [XXX] was already in the middle of the intersection (the delivery truck arrived at its stop sign first and proceeded into the intersection before the Waymo AV). As the Waymo AV passed the rear of the delivery truck, an occluded bicyclist who was traveling behind the delivery truck became visible and was making a sharp left turn onto northbound [XXX], in front of the Waymo AVs path. The Waymo AV detected the bicyclist, applied heavy braking, but was unable to avoid contact with the bicyclist before coming to a full stop. 
At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor body damage, and to our knowledge, the bicyclist reported only minor injuries. The Waymo AV remained stopped in the intersection for approximately one minute, and after the path was clear resumed driving for a short period of time.

As always, there were two safety drivers in the car. Traffic was moving in all four lanes at or near the speed limit. The Ghost vehicle was in the right-middle lane. Another vehicle (the ""lead"" car) entered into the Ghost car's lane from the right. While there were numerous vehicles ahead of the Ghost car before that vehicle entered the lane, the lead vehicle blocked the view of the lane before it. Throughout the incident, traffic in the other three lanes continued at a steady pace.
When the lead vehicle entered into the lane ahead of the Ghost car, the Ghost car applied the brakes to accommodate the intrusion and then continued to match the speed of the lead car. The lead car suddenly slammed the brakes. The Ghost car followed suit, reducing its speed from 19 mps (42.5 mph) to 4.7 mps (10.5 mph) within the next three seconds. The Ghost car was able to match the rapid speed reduction of the lead car and avoid contact.
The driver following the Ghost car was not able to respond as quickly as the Ghost ADS. When the following driver began to apply the brakes, the car was about five meters behind and was traveling at 6.5 mps. At the point of impact, the Ghost vehicle was traveling at 4.78 mps (10.7 mph), matching the lead car. There were no injuries. The vehicles suffered only cosmetic damage, the drivers exchanged information, and the Ghost safety drivers returned to home base in conventional mode.",

NHTSA-Provided Report # 30530-6818-1
This incident occurred near Ranger, TX on [XXX]  approximately 9:56 am CT on November [XXX], 2023. The Aurora vehicle was operating in autonomy at the time. Conditions were overcast, with light rain. As the Aurora vehicle was driving in its lane at 67 mph, a Ford pick-up truck overtaking the Aurora vehicle in the rightmost lane at approximately 80 mph appears to have hydroplaned, lost control, and hit the passenger-side rear portion of the trailer. 
Before the collision, the Aurora Driver detected the pick-up truck's encroachment into the Aurora vehicle's lane and initiated a nudge to the left to provide space. This was insufficient to completely avoid the collision, and the pickup truck made contact with the passenger side rear of the trailer. The Aurora Driver detected the collision and made the decision to initiate an incident response, but before it could execute that response, the Vehicle Operator took over control of the system and proceeded in manual. The Vehicle Operator received the notification that a collision had been detected and was initiating an incident response. The Vehicle Operator did not visually observe the collision and therefore assumed the reaction of the Aurora Driver to be a software anomaly worth escalated attention, rather than the correct detection of a collision and thus reported the incident through our escalated annotation protocol, rather than through our incident response protocols. We identified the incident at approximately 8:45 am CT on December [XXX], 2023 through a review of our data logs.
At this time, we are not aware of any injuries and, from camera footage, the pick-up truck also appears to have left the scene of the incident. There is also no indication of any cargo or major trailer damage.",

There are no other changes to Cruise's previous submission (30412-6395-3): A Cruise autonomous vehicle (AV), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on southbound [XXX] at the intersection with [XXX]. A dark colored Nissan Sentra was also stopped in the adjacent lane to the left of the AV. As the Nissan Sentra and the AV proceeded through the intersection after the light turned green, a pedestrian entered the crosswalk on the opposite side of [XXX] across from the vehicles and proceeded through the intersection against a red light. The pedestrian passed completely through the AVs lane of travel but stopped mid-crosswalk in front of the Nissan Sentra. Shortly thereafter, the Nissan Sentra made contact with the pedestrian, deflecting the pedestrian in front of the AV. The AV braked aggressively but, shortly thereafter, made contact with the pedestrian. The AV then attempted to pull over out of traffic, pulling the individual forward, rather than remaining stationary. The driver of the Nissan Sentra left the scene shortly after the collision. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to the scene and the pedestrian was transported by EMS. On November 2, 2023, Cruise submitted a voluntary recall report to NHTSA relating to the AVs response after the collision, based on updated analysis that Cruise performed since the filing of the previous submissions.",Y

The vehicles internal facing cameras show that the operator started to fall asleep while applying physical input to the steering wheel. The road started to bend to the left. The physical input from the operator was enough to deviate the vehicle from its intended path but not enough to trigger an intervention and take the vehicle out of autonomy. The vehicle, going straight as the road curved, then struck the curb, resulting in minor vehicle damage. Due to the vehicle being off path, the vehicle begins to stop. This occurs as the operator wakes up. The operator was not injured and no third parties were impacted or otherwise affected by the incident. 
The local May Mobility site staff did not notice any signs of fatigue from this operator prior to going out in the vehicle.

On November [XXX], 2023 at 10:43 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a passenger car on [XXX] at [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling northbound in the left lane on [XXX] and stopped at a red light at the intersection with [XXX] alongside a passenger vehicle in the right lane. After the light turned green, both the Waymo AV and the adjacent passenger car proceeded into the intersection. While in the intersection, a passenger car traveling west on [XXX] ran the red light and the front left corner and left side of this vehicle made contact with the front right of the Waymo AV and the front of the adjacent passenger car. After impact, the vehicle that ran the red light struck pedestrians that had been standing on the sidewalk on the northwest corner of the intersection. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. All three vehicles sustained damage and were towed from the scene.
Waymo is reporting this crash under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01 because an individual involved was transported from the scene to a hospital for medical treatment, and a vehicle involved was towed away.

A Cruise autonomous vehicle (AV), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on southbound [XXX] at the intersection with [XXX]. A dark colored Nissan Sentra was also stopped in the adjacent lane to the left of the AV. As the Nissan Sentra and the AV proceeded through the intersection after the light turned green, a pedestrian entered the crosswalk on the opposite side of [XXX] across from the vehicles and proceeded through the intersection against a red light. The pedestrian passed completely through the AVs lane of travel but stopped mid-crosswalk in front of the Nissan Sentra. Shortly thereafter, the Nissan Sentra made contact with the pedestrian, deflecting the pedestrian in front of the AV. The AV braked aggressively but, shortly thereafter, made contact with the pedestrian. The AV then attempted to pull over out of traffic, pulling the individual forward, rather than remaining stationary. The driver of the Nissan Sentra left the scene shortly after the collision. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to the scene and the pedestrian was transported by EMS. On November 2, 2023, Cruise submitted a voluntary recall report to NHTSA relating to the AVs response after the collision, based on updated analysis that Cruise performed since the filing of the previous submissions.

The BCC later informed LYNX dispatch at 12:49PM that the second shuttle operating on route, P131, would also be returning to storage after the operator completed its current loop. At Approximately 12:52 PM, P131 approached the [XXX] stop within the designated Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) operating lane. The shuttle remained stopped for approximately two (2) and a half minutes while three (3) passengers alighted, and two (2) additional passengers boarded the shuttle. During that period, approximately two (2) minutes after stopping to service passengers, a LYNX bus pulled behind P131. Approximately thirty (30) seconds later, the LYNX bus exited the BRT lane and proceeded into the public travel lane alongside the BRT lane. As the LYNX bus entered the public travel lane, the safety driver onboard P131 engaged the autonomous drive system, and the shuttle proceeded in the BRT lane. After both vehicles had begun moving, P131 in the BRT lane and the LYNX bus in the public travel lane, the LYNX bus reentered the BRT lane encroaching on the shuttles path. The bus failed to provide adequate clearance and contacted the left front side of P131. Both vehicles stopped in the BRT lane after the collision. 
Within five (5) minutes of the collision, all passengers had safely alighted from the shuttle with no reported injuries and left the scene without giving statements. At approximately 2:20PM, the City of Orlando Police Department (OPD) arrived on scene to investigate the incident. Beep and LYNX supervisors were on scene to support the investigation. OPD collected statements from both the Beep safety driver and LYNX bus driver. The LYNX supervisor provided OPD access to the LYNX bus camera footage on scene, at which point the investigating officer made a verbal indication that the LYNX bus driver appeared to be at fault for the collision. 
Beeps safety driver was subsequently subjected to a standard post-collision drug and alcohol screening. 
1.The safety driver did not exhibit complete situational awareness and per their after-incident interview, failed to notice the bus prior to departing the station. Had the attendant continued to look and check behind/alongside P131 prior to departing the station,
the collision may have been avoided.
2.The safety driver attempted to stop the shuttle by disengaging the ADS using the HMI rather than using the emergency stop button. Use of the emergency stop would have increased the deceleration rate to 5 m/s2, decreasing the stopping distance of the shuttle. However, it is not clear whether use of the emergency stop would have fully avoided the collision given the point at which the LYNX LYMMO bus entered the BRT lane.
3.Deficiencies in the standard operating procedures (SOP) between LYNX and Beep allowed for a bus to be deployed onto the service at the same time as P131. Beep communicated to LYNX that both shuttles were exiting the service area. However, LYNX did not wait for final confirmation that both vehicles had left the route prior to dispatching the LYMMO bus involved in the incident, nor did LYNX notify Beep that a bus had been dispatched.

At approximately 5:54 p.m. on Wednesday, August [XXX], 2023, P84, travelling eastbound on [XXX], approached the three-way stop at [XXX] and [XXX]. P84 arrived at the intersection at the same time as two other vehicles: a grey van heading northbound on [XXX] and a red sedan heading westbound on [XXX]. The safety driver yielded to the northbound vehicle, which proceeded to make a right-hand turn eastbound onto [XXX]. After allowing the intersection to clear, the safety driver onboard P84 confirmed that it was safe for the shuttle to proceed through the intersection. As the shuttle entered the intersection, a second vehicle travelling northbound on [XXX], a white sedan, entered the intersection intending a left-hand turn onto westbound [XXX]. Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously, subsequently colliding at a low rate of speed in the middle of the intersection.  
At approximately 5:57 p.m., the Beep Command Center (BCC) was informed by the safety driver that P84 was involved in a minor collision with another vehicle at the intersection of [XXX] and [XXX]. The incident response protocol was initiated, and a supervisor dispatched to the scene. Local law enforcement (San Francisco Police Department) was contacted to report the collision but declined to respond given the minor nature of the collision, directing both parties to exchange information. After the Beep supervisor arrived on scene at approximately 6:49 p.m., the safety driver and supervisor removed the shuttle from the roadway and exchanged insurance information with the driver of the other vehicle. 
Damage to both vehicles was noted to be very minor. The shuttle sustained light scuffs, chips, and small paint transfer. The other vehicle sustained a small dent on the fender. Neither vehicle required towing, and both were safely driven from the scene. 
Beeps safety driver was subsequently subjected to a standard post-collision drug & alcohol screening which has since cleared.  
Contributing Factors 
Based on an analysis of the available evidence, Beep has determined the following factors may have contributed to the higher likelihood of a collision occurring in this instance: 
1.The white sedan failed to yield to P84 in accordance with California state law governing intersection priority.
2.The slight bend in P84s path to accommodate the lane shift through the intersection may have reduced the available stopping distance as the white sedan was not perceived as an obstacle in P84s path until it proceeded further into the intersection.
Incident Findings 
Beep developed the following findings regarding this incident:
1.P84 behaved as expected, detecting and maintaining awareness of the white sedan in the moments preceding the collision, commanding hard braking maneuver, and achieving a 3m/s2 deceleration rate once the white sedan encroached on P84s path.
2.The safety driver observed California state law and had the right of way when releasing P84 into the intersection.
3.The safety driver could have avoided the collision by using the emergency stop. The safety driver indicated that they were aware of the other vehicle through the duration of the incident and were aware of the proper procedure in this scenario but panicked in the moment.
Mitigation:
Implement a priority zone to account for the slight bend in the shuttles path and for future vehicles that may fail to yield.",

Traffic slowed quickly, apparently due to a crash ahead of the Ghost car.  Consistent with their training, the Ghost driver took control of the car by manually braking and disengaging the autonomous system.  The car was traveling 55.3 mph when the driver began to brake.  The Ghost car stopped without impacting the preceding car.  A Mercedes car immediately following the Ghost car also came to a stop without impacting the Ghost car.  Ghost's understanding based on communications at the scene is that a Grand Cherokee traveling behind the Mercedes tried to swerve to avoid impacting the Mercedes but clipped the Mercedes and rolled over.  To Ghost's knowledge, nobody in the Grand Cherokee was injured.  The Ghost drivers heard a noise and then found that the rear bumper of the Ghost car had been damaged, which Ghost believes resulted from crash debris. The Ghost drivers drove the Ghost car back to the garage in conventional mode.",

The Waymo AV was stopped at a red light in the middle lane, facing northbound on [XXX] at [XXX]. When the light turned green, the pickup truck in the left turn lane to the left of the Waymo AV did not immediately proceed, and the Waymo AV attempted to merge into the left lane and make a left turn onto westbound [XXX] to pick up a rider that had hailed the Waymo AV while the vehicle was waiting at the red light. As the Waymo AV moved into the left lane, the adjacent pickup truck began to proceed forward and made contact with the drivers side of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage.
Waymo is reporting this crash under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01 because a vehicle involved was towed away.

As the Waymo AV was braking and had slowed to 3 mph, a passenger vehicle behind the Waymo made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. Moments later, an SUV behind the passenger vehicle made contact with the rear of the passenger vehicle. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. All vehicles sustained damage. Rather than wearing the seat belt, the passenger in the Waymo AV was sitting on the buckled seat belt at the time of the collision. The passenger declined medical attention.

On [XXX], 2023 at 1:17 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in Phoenix, AZ was in a collision involving a passenger car on [XXX] in the southbound direction near the [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling in the rightmost lane (out of 5 lanes) in the southbound direction of [XXX],  and the left 3 lanes were closed due to a work zone. The vehicle traveling ahead in the same lane as the ADV made an abrupt lane change to the left, revealing a stack of slow-moving vehicles in the Waymo AVs lane. The test driver of the Waymo AV took manual control of the vehicle and started to decelerate and steer toward the right shoulder in response to slow traffic ahead. A passenger vehicle approached the Waymo AV from behind and made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver (in the drivers seating position) was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV and the other vehicle sustained damage. The test driver reported an injury, for which they later sought medical treatment. 
Waymo reported this crash under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01. Waymo may supplement or correct its reporting with additional information as it may become available.",

The following vehicle was traveling approximately twice as fast as the May shuttle and catching up to the May shuttle from behind. The May shuttle began to slow for traffic ahead, which was stopping for a red light, but the following vehicle did not decelerate. While slowing, the May shuttle identified a bollard on the side of the road as a likely pedestrian and added a safety buffer which intersected with the predicted trajectory of the shuttle. This caused the shuttle to increase deceleration to avoid the projected collision with the buffer. The following vehicle started braking late and impacted the May shuttle from behind with a relative velocity of 6.2 m/s. Re-simulation of this event with a future software version shows that the May shuttle would have decelerated less abruptly.",

Before the e-scooter could also pass the Zoox vehicle on the right, the e-scooter weaved away from the curb, seemingly to avoid a drainage grate, and came within a close following distance behind the Zoox vehicle. As the Zoox vehicle came to a stop again for traffic ahead the e-scooter rider did not stop, and the e-scooter made contact with the right rear tail light of the Zoox vehicle. The e-scooter rider remained upright, did not stop to exchange information, and immediately rode off while the Zoox vehicle was still stopped. There were no injuries and police were not called. The damage to the Zoox vehicle was limited to a cracked tail light lens. This 10-Day update provides complete information for this incident.",

At 11:01 am, while running the normal route, the Olli contacted the adjacent curb on the front right side, causing tie rod and cosmetic damage. No one was injured and the only damage was to the vehicle itself. The customer contacted RRAI through the client support portal shortly after the incident. No injuries occurred, there were no passengers besides the safety operator, no other vehicles were involved, and no emergency systems were engaged.
Olli 2.0 (S/N 2-18) is an 8-passenger shuttle that is no longer manufactured. The vehicle manufacturer, Local Motors, dissolved in 2022. Local Motors contracted RRAI to install autonomy kits for several Olli shuttles during the period of 2018 - 2020. RRAI provided some support for initial site deployment and ensured customer safety operators were trained on the autonomy system. Since the Local Motors dissolution in 2022, almost all Olli vehicles have been decommissioned.
To date, we have concluded the following:
1. There were no updates or alterations made by RRAI in the months prior to Jan [XXX]. In previous operations, including the immediately preceding operations on January 20th, 2023, Olli 2-18 ran the route as normal with no anomalies. There were no software updates or other system changes before it was run again on January [XXX], 2023, the date of curb contact.
2. The root cause of the curb contact was a communication error with the HD Map registration module. HD Map registration utilizes real-time lidar and positioning data and compares that to a-priori HD maps stored within the autonomy system. A communication problem occurred between the computer running the map registration software and the computer running the navigation algorithms. The cause for the communication problem has been identified and a fix has been implemented to prevent the issue from happening again (see below).
3. Steering was out of calibration. It was noted through data collection that the steering was out of calibration at time of incident. The autonomy system was attempting to correct this issue, but the vehicular steering system could not achieve the required turn radius. This is a vehicular maintenance concern managed by the customer.
It was determined that the HD map registration issue had not been observed during autonomous operations in the previous four years. The solution to prevent further occurrences includes:
1. Implementing a self-diagnostic routine upon system boot, which ensures the communication connection is established. If the connection is not established, this diagnostic will prevent the vehicle from driving autonomously. 
2. Updating the error checks to ensure that during run time, the vehicle will come to a controlled stop in event of a communication problem.  
3. Working with the customer to recalibrate the steering, and assisting in reviewing customer's vehicle maintenance checks for steering calibration if necessary.
4. Continuing to review data to determine other concerns or improvements.",

On January [XXX], 2023 at 1:38 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in Phoenix, Arizona was in a collision with a minibike whose rider was no longer on it on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling in the leftmost lane on eastbound [XXX], with a group of smaller motorcycles, more commonly known as minibikes, traveling in the right adjacent lane next to and ahead of the Waymo AV. A minibike rider in the group lost control and fell off the minibike a short distance ahead of the Waymo AV in the adjacent lane and the minibike, without a rider, tumbled into the Waymo AV's lane. The Waymo AV applied maximum brake force but made contact with the riderless minibike just before coming to a stop. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage. The minibike was damaged but it is not possible to determine whether all or some of that damage occurred when the minibike fell to the road before the collision. Because we checked on the minibike riders well-being shortly after the crash, Waymo is aware that the individual sustained minor injuries when they fell from the minibike but the subsequent collision with the riderless minibike did not cause those injuries.

While driving along [XXX] under autonomous control, the shuttle encountered a parked vehicle partially blocking its path, requiring disengagement of the autonomous drive system.  The safety driver attempted to manually drive the shuttle around the parked vehicle to reengage the autonomous drive system.  While manually steering the shuttle around the parked vehicle blocking its path, the shuttle failed to respond to manual control input and steered to the left, impacting a parked vehicle at a low rate of speed on the opposite side of [XXX].  The six passengers onboard alighted the shuttle, an accident report was filed with the local police, and the shuttle was removed from the scene.  Initial reports from the onboard safety driver indicated that while steering around the vehicle blocking the shuttle's path, the shuttle became unresponsive to control input.  The safety driver released the operator present button on the vehicle controller, which serves as dead man switch however, the vehicle failed to stop.  After the incident, further investigation by Navya confirmed that the root cause of the incident was a failure of the Xbox 360 controller used to manually control the vehicle.  Contact with the parked vehicle occurred between the time of failure and the vehicle drive system recognizing that the controller had failed an elapsed time of 4.05 seconds. In response to the incident, Beep suspended operation of all Navya ARMA vehicles pending identification and implementation of appropriate solutions to mitigate the risk of this failure leading to future incidents.
Subsequent investigation by Beep and Navya determined that the vehicle control software, NavyaDrive, is limited in its ability to monitor the validity of control signal input received from the Xbox 360 controller.  As the safety driver began to manually steer the vehicle, the controller failed, sending constant turning input to the vehicle drive system leading to the collision.  Though Navya developed software mitigations due to prior issues encountered with the controller, those mitigations were ineffective with respect to the failure leading to the incident on December [XXX].  Further, due to the short time between the controller failing and the collision (2.34sec), the safety driver was unable to identify the controller failure and trigger the emergency stop before the collision occurred.
In response to the incident, Navya is integrating a revised manual control system on the ARMA shuttle platform.  The revised manual control system utilizes industrial-grade components for improved electromechanical reliability and allows for active monitoring of the control system health, eliminating the root cause of the failure that led to the incident on December [XXX].  Software upgrades of all Navya ARMA vehicles will further reintroduce automated braking function while the ARMA vehicle is under manual control.  Beep is working with Navya to retrofit its fleet of ARMA vehicles with the revised manual control system as well as retrain and recertify its safety driver staff on the updated NavyaDrive software.
Discussion of the root cause analysis and solution design for the revised manual control system will be provided to NHTSA as a supplement to this report.",

The safety operator suggested that the safety driver disengage the ADS and make the turn in manual mode because the vehicle was hesitant in approaching the intersection. The safety driver disengaged the ADS, and, approximately 250ms later, subject vehicle was lightly struck from behind by a white Mazda3.  Having seen debris on the roadway, the driver and operator believed they had run over a rock and did not realize they were hit by the vehicle. After concluding the mission, the driver and operator found damage to a sensor during an inspection.  A subsequent review of video led to discovery of the crash.

TuSimple's position is that this event does not meet the criteria for reporting under the SGO.
Specifically, the L4 ADS was not in operation at any point in the 30 seconds prior to making contact with the concrete barrier.
The event occurred as follows:
As the truck was being operated on the highway, within its mapped ODD, the driver and test engineer attempted to engage the ADS.
However, the ADS was not functional at that moment due to the computer unit not having been initialized, and should not have been
attempted to be activated. In short, this was a failed attempt to engage the system as a result of human error.
The system has now been modified to prevent the ADS from attempting to engage unless the health of the system is fully functional to
prevent human error from repeating this event.
When the erroneous attempt to engage occurred, the uninitialized vehicle control unit rotated the steering to the left, causing the truck to
veer left. The safety driver took control of the steering, and was able to steer accordingly, but not before the left front truck tire and left
front quarter panel came into contact with the concrete barrier to the left of the lanes of travel.",

The Beep shuttle attendant was traveling Southbound on [XXX] at approx 7-12 mph in ADS and headed towards the intersection of [XXX]. Beep vehicle stopped at red light at intersection. As the Beep vehicle was crossing the intersection in manual and slowing to a stop to return to ADS in a southbound direction, the trailing bus made light contact with its bicycle rack to the Beep shuttle rear end. The trailing vehicle is a bus owned and operated by the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA). According to video, as reported by the shuttle attendant and the PSTA Road Supervisor, the bus was tailgating. 
 
Root Cause: Trailing vehicle following too closely and not observing Navya slowing to a stop.",

The May vehicle passed too close to a parked vehicle, causing the May vehicle's passenger-side mirror to contact the parked vehicle's driver-side mirror.
The May vehicle's ground mapping module had fallen significantly behind in its processing of lidar data. As a result, actual objects were being filtered out of the lidar data during object detection. This filtering caused the truck to oscillate between being detected, detecting only the cab, detecting the cab and mirror, and not being detected at all.
After assessing the issue, it has been determined that ground map latency alone will not cause safety issues. There is no risk to VRUs, or anything at ground level. The issue was with something in the air (mirror), above the ground.
A permanent fix to address the ground map latency issue is in process and will be implemented in the entire fleet within the next 30 days.
The second factor in the collision is that we were artificially constraining the vehicle to the right side of the road due to ambiguous and unpainted roadway. If we change that constraint to an advisory line (and allow the vehicle to cross the line to the left), we would have been far enough to the left to avoid collision (simulation success).
Solution Implementation: AVO training for extra caution related to protruding items like mirrors (short term), software changes coming in the next update and hotfix (within 30 days), and further improvement in the following update (within 60 days).
Until the tested software changes are implemented, we have advised the AVOs to take extra caution in these scenarios and to continue to disengage autonomy when desired. As always, we sacrifice autonomy for safety, as needed.",

Specifically, the L4 ADS was not in operation at any point in the 30 seconds prior to making contact with the concrete barrier.  
 
The event occurred as follows:
As the truck was being operated on the highway, within its mapped ODD, the driver and test engineer attempted to engage the ADS.  However, the ADS was not functional at that moment due to the computer unit not having been initialized, and should not have been attempted to be activated.  In short, this was a failed attempt to engage the system as a result of human error.  
 
The system has now been modified to prevent the ADS from attempting to engage unless the health of the system is fully functional to prevent human error from repeating this event.
 
When the erroneous attempt to engage occurred, the uninitialized vehicle control unit rotated the steering to the left, causing the truck to veer left.  The safety driver took control of the steering, and was able to steer accordingly, but not before the left front truck tire and left front quarter panel came into contact with the concrete barrier to the left of the lanes of travel.  
 
The contact resulted in a scuff to the left tire and damage to the radar unit extending from the left quarter panel.",

As required by the SGO, Pony.ai submitted a ""10-day"" update to the amended report on November [XXX], 2021. Subsequently, in a November [XXX], 2021 meeting with NHTSA, Pony.ai presented a full report regarding the crash and material facts and circumstances to a number of NHTSA officials, and answered the agency's questions. This supplemental ""Other"" Report is intended only to provide two minor technical corrections to Pony.ai's prior reports, in order to ensure the details of the written reports, as revised, are accurate. This is not a ""1-Day"", ""Monthly"" or ""Monthly-No Incidents"" Report. To facilitate a clear record, this ""Other"" Updated Report reproduces verbatim the narrative descriptions from the prior reports concerning this incident. 
UNEDITED NARRATIVE FROM ORIGINAL MONTHLY REPORT (11/[XXX]/21) AND AMENDED REPORT (11/[XXX]/21): On October [XXX], 2021, after turning right onto [XXX] from [XXX], the Pony.ai Autonomous Vehicle (""Pony.ai AV"") performed a left lane change maneuver in autonomous mode (SAE L4). While performing the lane change, the Pony.ai AV came into contact with a center divider on [XXX]. and the traffic sign that was posted on the divider. The Pony.ai AV suffered moderate damage to the front of the vehicle and the undercarriage. There were no injuries and no other vehicles involved. Fremont Police Department were called to report the incident and the damaged street sign. Pony.ai has subsequently worked with local authorities to resolve all issues related to the damaged sign. Please note that the latitude/longitude provided are GPS coordinates of the location address.
UNEDITED ADDITIONAL NARRATIVE FROM 10-DAY UPDATE: NHTSA has requested the Company to debrief the Agency on this incident. That meeting is scheduled for November 30, 2021.  Pony.ai will present a full updated report of the incident to NHTSA at that time and the current status of the Company's investigation.
TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS FOR THIS ""OTHER"" UPDATED REPORT (12/15/2021): Pony.ai provides the following corrections to its prior reports on the incident: (1) The Pony.ai AV did not turn onto [XXX] from [XXX] as first reported. Rather the Pony.ai AV was traveling straight on [XXX] and crossed through an intersection with [XXX] before entering the segment of [XXX] on which it changed lanes and subsequently had a collision; (2) Pony.ai has updated the VIN number of the subject vehicle in the data fields above, as there was one digit that was incorrect in our original reports due to a clerical error.",

On September [XXX], 2021 at 1:54 PM PDT, a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle ('Waymo AV') operating in Tempe, AZ was in a collision involving a pickup truck on [XXX] near [XXX]. While in autonomous mode, the Waymo AV began to enter the right lane of a protected double left turn lane (""Lane 2"") from northbound [XXX] to westbound [XXX]. A pickup truck heading southbound on [XXX] had completely crossed the double-yellow lines of the northbound double left turn lanes and positioned itself in the left lane of the double turn lane (""Lane 1"") facing the wrong direction against traffic and was preparing to make a left turn across Lane 2 and the other two northbound lanes into a shopping center parking lot on the east side of [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling in Lane 2 when the pickup truck began to initiate its left turn from Lane 1. The Waymo AV braked, and the trained human driver in the Waymo AV (in the driver's seating position), transitioned the vehicle from autonomous to manual mode. As the pickup truck made the left turn, the driver's side panels of the pickup truck made contact with the driver's side rear corner of the Waymo AV causing moderate damage to the Waymo AV. Damage to the pickup is currently unknown. At the time of contact, the Waymo AV was in manual mode.
Waymo is reporting this crash under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01 because the Waymo AV was towed from the scene. Waymo may supplement or correct its reporting with additional information as it may become available. This report was submitted from the Pacific time zone on the required date, which in this case was the next business day after a weekend.",

Summary of incident (as Toyota received from May Mobility):
Leading up to the event, the autonomy system functioned as expected, following the route through the intersection, slowing appropriately for other road users and the red light. Vehicle autonomous behavior was performing as expected and did not require a takeover.
